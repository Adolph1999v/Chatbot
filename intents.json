A \nhuman passenger is not required to take control of the \nvehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all.\n\nPlease type 'more' if you would like me to again show the \ntopics I can disuss!

However, they do \nhave the potential to be safer than human driven car but \nneeds additional engineering to prevent specific kinds of \ncognitive blind spots that can easily lead to accidents and \neven fatalities.\n\nPlease type 'more' if you would like me to again show the \ntopics I can disuss!
